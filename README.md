# Welcome to Frintern's Skill Checker Testing Repo
This repo is to provide feedback after testing during beta testing for our Skill Checker Tool

### Welcome Frinterneers :wave: Thank you so much for joining us! We are super excited to have you help us make this tool better with your feedback.

## Skill Checker is currently a prototype and we are excited to get your feedback.

We are soooo excited to finally share with you what we have been working on. Keep in mind it’s still a work-in-progress/prototype and that’s where you come in. We want you all to be our eyes and help us discover anything that needs fixing before we share it to the world.

## When you find items you want us to review, [add an issue here](https://github.com/frintern/skill-checker-testing/issues/new) following the issue template

Thanks for all your help!

Cheers :smiley:
